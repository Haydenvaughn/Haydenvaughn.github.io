    The choice of the United States Department of Justice to press charges on a tech giant like Meta is not only a win for the Department of Housing and 
    Urban Development but for all Americans because it sets the precedent that tech conglomerates will be held accountable for their actions and must be 
    transparent about their proprietary technology that makes impactful decisions on people’s lives.

  <p>
    By attacking the algorithms Meta uses to choose which users are eligible specifically for housing ads, a highly regulated and protected sector, the 
    Department of Justice gives themselves the best chance of being able to see behind the curtain of “private corporation” bs that has kept companies 
    from being held responsible for their algorithms.  Until now, corporations have had the freedom to create whatever decision making algorithms they 
    felt like, disregarding the ethicality and morality of those algorithms' consequences.  It seems that companies like Meta only care about the accuracy 
    and therefore profit that can be obtained from utilizing their algorithms, so they opt to use demographic data that is easy for an algorithm to 
    separate into similar categories.  This is all fine and dandy when targeting ads about clothing, food, and other various consumer goods, because a lot 
    of what dictates a person’s decision making on how they spend their money is personal preference, which a lot of times boils down to that person's 
    background, which of course includes things like race, ethnicity, gender, etc. However, with things as important as having a place to live, companies 
    developing ad targeting or demographic targeting algorithms must do better about balancing equity with profits.  As humans we have the responsibility 
    to not inhibit our fellow beings from acquiring a place to seek shelter, and that was, maybe still is, exactly what Meta did.  Therefore, the 
    Department of Urban Housing and Development and the Department of Justice fulfilled their duty to regulate private corporations from causing harm to 
    the American Populace.  The real win in this case, is both the fact that upon being charged, Meta was forced to reveal the details behind one of their
    algorithms and that companies can be held responsible by the federal government for their technology.  The only unfortunate part of this case that 
    may have implications for future violations by Big Tech, is that Meta might not have to accept guilt in order for them to reach a settlement with the 
    Department of Justice. This means that instead of a precedent being set making all of Big Tech liable to transparency in the future, everytime the 
    Department of Justice wants to inquire about the details of a certain algorithm, they’ll have to go through this whole process again, which could very 
    well end in a very different manner depending on the circumstances of the case and the judge that decides on it.  This is a problem because these tech 
    companies have armies of the best lawyers money can buy and an unlimited legal budget, so everytime the DoJ has to go through this process, it will 
    cost taxpayers a ton of money and could have the outcome of completely turning over the legal precedent from this case with Meta.
