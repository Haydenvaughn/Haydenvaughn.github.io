  <h1>
    The wage theft data was seemingly collected in an ethical way that doesn't overtly affect the effected parties, and also gives a clear, albeit un-nuanced
    picture of wage theft since the data is observational.
  </h1>
    
 <h1>
   Ethical uses of this data include all uses to advocate for the affected parties, unethical uses are the those that perpetuate the conditions of wage 
   theft.
 </h1>
    
 <h1>
   Concluding if data is being used ethically is the same as any decision.  Is the use of this data more good than harm? If yes, its being used ethically.
   If no, it's being used unethically.
 </h1>
    
 <h1>
   Data scientists have a duty to not only be aware of potential unethical practices they could be partaking in, but must actively be fighting agaisn't 
   unethical data practices.
