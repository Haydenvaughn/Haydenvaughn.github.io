    picture of wage theft since the data is observational.
  </h1>

   Ethical uses of this data include all uses to advocate for the affected parties, unethical uses are the those that perpetuate the conditions of wage 
   theft.

   Concluding if data is being used ethically is the same as any decision.  Is the use of this data more good than harm? If yes, its being used ethically.
   If no, it's being used unethically.
