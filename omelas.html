  <h1>
    The work titled “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas”, puts forth the moral dilemma of which good matters more, the good of the many or the equality of the few.
  </h1>
  <p>
    The piece draws the reader in with the description of a seemingly utopian society where there exists none of the evil that plagues the modern world.  However, the author explains that this lack of societal issues doesn’t stem from the city reverting back to prehistoric tendencies, nor do they refuse to acknowledge that such strife exists.  The citizens are simply beyond such archaic attributes.  The author further draws the reader in by discussing the sexual tendencies of the city and how progressive they are.  Although there are orgy’s and pregnancies, there are no orphans.  This struck me as unusual because if nobody is claiming their children but raises them nonetheless, this points to a lack of identity in the community beyond belonging to the city.  This is the most unsupported argument of the piece. Life is personal, there is no shared conscience, there is just a natural desire to be an individual that cannot be satiated.  This implies rather than being a perfect society where there is no compromise, the citizens are constantly subduing their individuality for equality.  The author continually rationalizes the behavior of the citizens, citing the behavior is in fact the behavior of a place without evil and without selfishness.  The reader is made to wonder from all this persuasion, does the author truly believe the words they are writing, or have they simply proclaimed too much to recant.  The reader is also having to second guess themselves constantly.  Should they take the author’s words verbatim, should they be taken with some discretion, or should they be rejected altogether because they are too good to be true.  There can’t possibly exist a society, real or imaginary, that is perfect.  Humans are not perfect, they make mistakes, and are above all else selfish.  Humans aren’t a stand alone species on this earth, and if you believe in the theory of evolution, then you know that the human race evolved from invertebrates whose sole existence was to survive and reproduce. Humans always claim to be of a higher intelligence than any mammal before it, but it would be incorrect to assume that the innate desire to survive and live has been erased from their gene pool.  Therefore, humans are selfish. They have desires, they have needs both physical and emotional that derive from the need to survive and pass along their genetic code.  This is all to say that I enjoy the twist the author displays in the last pages of the work.  As I have believed all along, there is always take when there is give.  The citizens of Omelas are no better than any other society.  They are only more honest. They know what atrocities need to be done to keep their beautiful society burgeoning.  Then it must be asked, is the author telling us that is it wrong to exploit the plight of the few for the serenity of the many, or are they telling us that all it takes to have a society like Omelas’ is to accept that there are necessary sins and the majority simply has to be cognizant to those sins to be saved?
