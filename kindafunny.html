    There is no excuse to not have inclusive physical character traits in video games because it is as easy as seeking information about the physical traits from experts, or simply hiring a person who has these physical traits to design them for a game.
  </h1>
  <p>
    There are admittedly factors that make these solutions difficult, which were addressed in the video, such as a minimal pool of qualified persons that have both the ability to design video games and have the lacking physical traits due to both categories being minority
It is important to acknowledge however, that just because the pool of qualified applicants is small it is not an excuse not to seek them out for a game development team.  
Such efforts will lead to a better game, better sales, and most importantly a better society. The video explains that this issue is not a recent one, but has manifested itself this way because of the external factors of at best ignorance and at worst bigotry and racism.
However, this manifestation of those issues can be more harmful than the others because it affects the way people are able to express themselves the way they see themselves and are instead forced to portray themselves as figures not very alike to them.
Although I am no psychologist, there must be psychological consequences to children and adolescents who are unable to express themselves as they see fit and instead can only express themselves with certain characteristics.
This issue may seem trivial on the surface, but if all hair styles, complexions, and physical features were represented in popular media such as video games then perhaps there would be less division and ignorance since everyone will be exposed to traits different than theirs.
There are places in the US that are extremely insulated from the diversity that is today’s world. With similar logic to above, this would help those youths break the cycle of ignorance perpetuated by their parents and grandparents by exposing them to concepts that are different or challenge their norm.
Another good point that the video brings up is that the unrepresented people still make up a significant portion of the game sales. So there is a financial incentive to cater just a little to this demographic, but it seems like to these game development companies they are satisfied with the current profits from this demographic and feel it not worth it to change.
Maybe it’s time for peoples outside the affected group to get angry about the injustices being done to their fellow beings.  In our free market economy the only thing driving businesses are profits and as of now the game developers have no pressure (AKA lack of profit) to motivate them to change.  It’s all of our duties’  to demand change with words, but more importantly our actions.
To get the attention of the game development industry the best way is to simply boycott their games until they make the necessary changes to their characters to include all backgrounds and ethnicities.
