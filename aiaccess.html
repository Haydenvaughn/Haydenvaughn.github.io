    From the article, it seems that AI can provide a significant improvement to the lives of neurodivergent people by allowing neurodivergent children to more effectively learn verbal communication skills to help them better integrate into society later in their lives, and by helping neurodivergent adults better understand their managers’ requests by summarizing the requests in a more easily digestible way, which makes both employee and manager more productive.
  </h1>
  <p>
    I agree that the InnerVoice could provide a way for neurodivergent children to learn verbal communication at their pace and comfort, however I feel that simply pawning off a young and impressionable student to an app instead of providing them with one on one instruction, which also gives those students a safe and effective learning environment, could make a student less likely to be able to safely integrate into society later in their lives. To that end, why are software engineers deciding what the most effective learning method for neurodivergent students is when they have zero interest in the well-being of the students other than to sell them their software? Based on the article it seems that psychiatrists, pediatricians, and parents were not consulted in the development of this app, and my question is why? Additionally, accessibility in this case needs a better definition because only students with internet access and a compatible device are going to be able to utilize the learning benefits of the app, while those individuals without internet access and a compatible device are going to fall further behind and have an even harder time integrating into society after school.  If companies were supremely worried about all neurodivergent students and their ability to learn verbal communication, they would invest in the current learning infrastructure that could reach all students, rather than cater only to the families that can afford their “accessible” learning option.  This only perpetuates growing class distinctions and wealth gaps that make accessible education opportunities more and more important. Now those neurodivergent students are adults and ready to take on a career in any industry they choose.  They go to the interview, they land the job, and now it’s their first day of work.  An email is sent out to the office about some necessary functions that need to happen and it's full of inside jokes and obscure references.  The neurodivergent employee takes the words literally and is fired for misconduct.  The solution according to salesforce is to sell these companies a software that can analyze any writing and produce a synopsis that any person including a neurodivergent one will comprehend.  The issue is again that the producers of this tool don’t have the neurodivergent’s best interest at heart only profit, and since there is no oversight, the scenario I described above could just have easily been caused by an employee reading the Salesforce synopsis because AI doesn’t have the learned experience needed to parse something as complex and nuanced as a corporate email.  Which is almost precisely the obstacle neurodivergent people face; not having a software able translates everyone else’s words into a nice format for them to comprehend because they interact with the world around them differently that everybody else.  My solution: nuances can only be understood through effective and open communication aka learning.  As stated in the article, neurodivergent people are very good at pattern recognition and repetitive tasks, so they should have access to teachers, then professors, and then managers who are able to have the dialogue needed for a successful social interaction.  So the solution I propose boils down to throwing time and money at the problem, so unsurprisingly the problem will of course never be solved.
